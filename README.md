# Data_Alchemist
Data Alchemist is an interactive data analysis assistant built with Streamlit, Plotly, and Google Gemini LLM. It transforms raw datasets into actionable insights, visualisations, and forecasts through a chat-driven and manual interface.

Alchemy is about "transforming raw materials into gold".
Similarly, this project transforms raw messy data → valuable insights through automation, AI, and machine learning.
